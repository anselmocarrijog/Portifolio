Greetings all. Hope you can use this font or any of my others for any of your endevors. BUT... keep in mind please this is for personal use ONLY. And...this text file must be included with any distribution at all of this font. 

bosil unique Regular (TrueType) font has the basic punctuation for most needs. For a mostly free font, I think it will do. I prefer to always try to include numbers with any font. It's just the polite thing to do even if you don't want or need them.

Most of my fonts have just the basic punctuation for basic use but I can be easily bribed to add more charactors for your personal needs.

If you can use this in any Commercial projects that you are going to make some cash on, you gotta pay the price like everyone else.
The good thing is that I'm cheap.... and easy.
Just email me at obosilo@aol.com and let me know what you want to do with it.

If it's for a good cause, for something to sell on Zazzle or CafePress (I do like coffee mugs), LULU Press or any ego press printing outfit, or charitable events, all it may take is a sample of the sold item(s) or even honorable mention if it can be done, and I'm happy. 

Of course if you would like to use any of my fonts on your personal website, blog, or other type of non-commercial area of graphics, I would greatly appreciate any communication to see the results. It's an ego thing you know. Also, again, the honorable mention of course is always cool.

Now, of course, if you want to use any of my fonts for movie titles, Nationally or Internationally publications, books, magazines, mass produced products, or something outragous like such, we gotta talk first. I will always be cheap, (or even nearly free) but give me the THRILL AND EXCITEMENT of you asking. It's only fair and I may not live that long to see it for bragging rights.

email me at:

obosilo@aol.com

and please put something in the subject matter to let me know it's not spam. 

Enjoy!
